# Qixuan "Harrison" Ma
_Student at UC San Diego_

Hi there! I am a sophomore at the University of California, San Diego. Double major in Math-Computer Science and Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation with a minor in History. I have a strong interest in Bioinformatics, game development, and data analysis. Outside of school, I work as a undergraduate volunteer in bioinformatics for Neil Chi lab at UCSD School of Medicine and I play support for UCSD's varsity collegiate Overwatch Team. 

My favorite quote is: 
> Where is your mana? You have no mana. 

Learn to use `library(Seurat)` to be hired as a bioinformatician.
